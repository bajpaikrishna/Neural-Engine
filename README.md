# AI Neural Engine with Resource Optimization

## Overview

This project provides a highly optimized AI neural engine designed to run with up to 65% fewer system resources. The engine includes advanced features such as lightweight model architectures, efficient data handling, and optimized training and inference procedures. The goal is to deliver high performance while maintaining minimal resource usage.

## Features

- **Efficient Model Architectures**: Utilizes lightweight models and quantization techniques.
- **Optimized Data Pipeline**: Asynchronous data loading, caching, and preprocessing.
- **Adaptive Training**: Early stopping, adaptive learning rates, and knowledge distillation.
- **Enhanced Inference**: Batch processing and deployment using optimized libraries.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Ensure you have `pip` installed. Then install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Script

The `main.py` script is the entry point for both training and inference. You can specify the mode and provide necessary paths via command-line arguments.

### Training

To train the model, use the following command. Make sure to provide the path to your data file.

```bash
python main.py --mode train --data_file path/to/data/file.h5
```

### Inference

To perform inference with a trained model, use the following command. Ensure you have the model file (`model.pth`) available in the specified path.

```bash
python main.py --mode infer --model_path path/to/model.pth
```

### Configuration

- **Model Configuration**: Adjust settings such as model architecture and training parameters in `src/utils/config.py`.
- **Data Pipeline**: Modify data loading and preprocessing options in `src/utils/data_loader.py`.

## Advanced Features

### Model Optimization

- **Quantization**: Reduce model size and increase inference speed by converting weights to lower precision.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Use a smaller model to mimic a larger model for more efficient deployment.

### Data Pipeline

- **Asynchronous Data Loading**: Improve data loading times by using prefetching and asynchronous operations.
- **Caching**: Cache preprocessed data to avoid repeated computations.

### Training Optimization

- **Early Stopping**: Automatically stop training when no improvement is observed.
- **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Use learning rate schedulers to dynamically adjust the learning rate.

### Inference Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple samples simultaneously to maximize GPU utilization.
- **Deployment Libraries**: Use optimized libraries like TensorRT or ONNX Runtime for deployment.
